This is a Python library for interacting with the Raspberry Pi's DispmanX video
API. Some use cases for this are,

  * Directly writing to the lowlevel graphics layer of your Pi with relatively
    high performance (for Python). There's no need to install X11.
  * Small [pygame][pygame] or [Pillow][pillow]-based applications can be overlayed
    onto the screen, with full support for transparency.

This library uses [ctypes][ctypes] to directly interact with your Raspberry Pi's
`bcm_host.so` library.

## Usage

See the [Quickstart section in the docs][quickstart].

## TODO List

- [x] Publish package to [PyPI][pypi]
- [ ] Add API docs using [MkDocs][mkdocs], [Material for MkDocs][mkdocs-material],
    and [mkdocstrings][mkdocstrings]
- [ ] Allow multiple layers
- [ ] Support additional pixel types
- [ ] Support custom dimensions and offsets â€“ API supports it, but requires weird
    multiples of 16 or 32, [as documented here](picamera-overlay-docs). This
    requires testing, because anecdotally it seems to work with smaller multiples.
- [ ] Test run over SSH onto my home pi
