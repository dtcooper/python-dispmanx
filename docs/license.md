## Author

Hi! I'm David Cooper. I'm the author of Python DispmanX. I'm reachable for
feedback or questions at <david@jew.pizza>.

I'm a software engineer :floppy_disk: turned radio personality :radio:. I used
to be a professional programmer and then engineering manager, but coding is now
just a hobby. My mother :family_woman_boy: thinks I'm crazy :zany_face:.

Find out more or listen :ear: at
