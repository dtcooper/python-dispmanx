# Additional Information

Below is more information about the Python DispmanX library, including
what's supported, how to install the necessary requirements (`bcm_host.so`), and some
acknowledgements.

## Python, OS and Device Version Support

OS Support:
:   The latest versions of 32- and 64- bit Raspberry Pi OS are supported. As of
    the time of this writing, that's based on
    [Debian Bullseye (11.x)][debian-bullseye].

Python Version
:   The minimum version of Python supported is 3.9. That's the default version
    installed on the latest [Raspberry Pi OS][pi-os] (Bullseye).

Raspberry Pi Versions
:   This library _should_ work on any version of the Pi, but I've specifically
    tested,

    1. Raspberry Pi 4 B
    2. Raspberry Pi 3 B+
    3. Raspberry Pi 3 B
    4. Raspberry Pi 2
    5. Raspberry Pi B

If you're using an older version of Python, Raspberry Pi OS, and/or a different OS
entirely, you can always use [Docker] on your Pi. See the section on
[Docker and Compose][docker-and-compose] below.


## [ctypes][] and `bcm_host.so`

While Python DispmanX is written completely in Python, it uses Python's included
[ctypes][] library to perform "foreign function calls" to `bcm_host.so`. In
short, it calls the C library included with Raspberry Pi OS to interface with
the DispmanX layer directly.

The library `bcm_host.so` is available through the `libraspberrypi0` Debian
package, which should have come installed on your Pi if you used Raspberry Pi
OS. If that's not available, you can always use [Docker] following the
instructions in the [Docker and Compose][docker-and-compose] section below.


## [Docker] and [Compose]

Both [Docker] and [Docker Compose][Compose] work great. They're actually how I run
the library. Details below.

### Using [Docker]

If the version of [Raspberry Pi OS][pi-os] that you're using isn't supported by
this library or you're using a different operating system altogether, you can
always use [Docker]. Docker is supported on both 32- and 64-bit architectures.

The base container for Debian Bullseye doesn't by default contain the necessary
`libraspberrypi0` package as described above. So, you'll need to either add the
["Raspbian Repository"][raspbian-repo], or use my
[minimal Raspberry Pi OS base containers][pi-base-containers]. Three variants
that will work are provided.

The device `/dev/vchiq` needs to be exposed to container. For the Debian image,
you'll need to install pip yourself. Three images are listed in the table below.

| Description       | Image Name                           |
|------------------:|:-------------------------------------|
| Python 3.9        | `dtcooper/raspberrypi-os:python3.9`  |
| Python 3.10       | `dtcooper/raspberrypi-os:python3.10` |
| Debian (Bullseye) | `dtcooper/raspberrypi-os:bullseye`   |

For example to use the Python 3.9 container with a script called `test.py` in
your current directory run this at the command line,

```bash
docker run -it \
    -v "./test.py:/test.py" \
    --device /dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq \
    dtcooper/raspberrypi-os:python3.9 \
  bash
# Now in the container
pip install dispmanx[numpy]
python /test.py
```

### Using [Compose]

Using [Docker Compose][compose] also works great. You'll need to similarly
expose the `/dev/vchiq` device, however. Here's a sample `docker-compose.yml`
file,

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  dispmanx:
    #image: <Your image based on dtcooper/raspberrypi-os:python3.9>
    devices:
      - /dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq
```


## Acknowledgements

Several projects were used as reference in the development of Python DispmanX. Some
of the main ones are described below.

### [PyDispmanx]

First and foremost, let me acknowledge the great work [Tim Clark] put into
[PyDispmanx].

[PyDispmanx] is another Python library available that functions somewhat
similarly. Honestly, it's great and I would recommend it! I owe a debt of
gratitude to its author, for two reasons,

1. First and foremost, showing me that interfacing with the Pi's DispmanX API
   via Python is possible; and
2. Being available to peep into its source code.

While it's perhaps the best alternative to this project, some reasons I've
chosen to re-write from scratch are:

 * To provide a [ctypes][] pure Python interface;
 * To provide a more complete interface to DispmanX;
 * To provide documentation on how to use the thing with popular Python
   graphics libraries;
 * To publish regular, stable, and tested releases to [PyPI];
 * [PyDispmanx] appears to be an unstable work in progress. For
   example, by its own author's admission in the project README, he says
   _"\[he\] probably wouldn't install this system wide yet";_ and
 * _Writing code is fun!_

### [raspidmx]

The Broadcom hardware interface library which provides the DispmanX APIs is very
poorly documented. One of the first usable set of open source C programming
language example programs were by a developer named
[Andrew Duncan]. He calls the suite [raspidmx]. Andrew
provided a set of "programs [that could] be used as a starting point for anyone
wanting to make use of DispmanX."

Some of the common code from [raspidmx] is the underlying code that drives
[PyDispmanx]. I owe a debt of gratitude to its author, since peeping into
[raspidmx]'s source tree is what helped figure out how to call the DispmanX APIs
from Python.

### [picamera]

The [picamera] Python library interfaces with the
[Pi's Camera Module][pi-camera-module]. Its source code contains several parts
that interface with the Pi's APIs including the DispmanX layer contained in the
`bcm_host.so` shared library. In particular [picamera]'s source file
[`bcm_host.py`][bcm-host-py] was used as inspiration for how to interact with
DispmanX via [ctypes][].

## Project Roadmap

- [x] Publish package to PyPI
- [x] Add API docs using MkDocs, Material for MkDocs, mkdocstrings
- [x] Call destroy functions in bcm_host.h
- [x] Support additional pixel types
- [ ] Allow multiple layers, and different displays
- [ ] Support custom dimensions and offsets â€“ API supports it, but requires weird
    multiples of 16 or 32, [as documented here][picamera-overlay-docs]. This
    requires testing, because anecdotally it seems to work with smaller multiples.
- [ ] Tests run over SSH onto my home pi &mdash; GitHub actions won't work,
    since they don't support DispmanX APIs
